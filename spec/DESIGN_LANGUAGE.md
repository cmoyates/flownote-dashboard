# Design Language

Our design language is built around a few core principles:

- **Minimalism & Clarity:** We prioritize a clean, uncluttered interface. Essential elements are highlighted, white space is used generously, and a clear visual hierarchy helps users navigate easily.
- **Developer Focus:** The UI is crafted for developers, featuring monospaced fonts, integrated code snippets, and an emphasis on both functionality and performance.
- **Readable Typography:** Legibility is key. We use clear, developer-friendly typography to make content easy to scan and understand.
- **Dark Mode First:** While not exclusive, dark mode is a primary theme—reducing eye strain and providing a modern look that resonates with developers.
- **Reusable Components:** Inspired by shadcn/ui, our components are designed for easy reuse and customization, supporting a "copy-and-paste" workflow common in developer tools.

**Visual Elements:**

- **Color Palette:** The palette is mostly monochrome—black, white, and grays—with accent colors reserved for important actions or highlights.
- **Grid-Based Layouts:** Structured, grid-based layouts maintain order and clarity throughout the app.
- **Modern Components:** Buttons, forms, and cards have a modern, distinctive style, often with subtle animations and hover effects that enhance usability without distraction. The influence of shadcn/ui is evident in the cohesive look and feel of our components.
